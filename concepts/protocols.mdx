Assuming we have two endpoints connected, yay! Now we just have to… do something… with that connection. That’s where protocols come in.

## Introduction

A protocol sets up everything we need to both provide data we have locally when
others request it, and ask other endpoints that run the protocol to do whatever
business or application logic we need.

Coming from the world of HTTP client/server models, protocols are similar to 
request handlers. However, they go beyond request/response by creating multiple
streams of data and usually include both initiating & accepting protocol
connections in the same client.

Peer to peer protocols do not require a client/server distinction, both sides
can initiate and accept connections. However, you can still build client/server
style protocols on top of iroh if you want to.

Protocols are modules you compose together to add functionality to connections.
Protocols exist for file transfer, game server sync, message broadcasting,
document collaboration, all kinds of stuff. You can use off-the-shelf protocols
to quickly add functionality, work directly with QUIC streams & build a fully
custom protocol that does exactly what you want, or fork an existing protocol to
get what you need.
