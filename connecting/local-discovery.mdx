Placeholder: Using mDNS for local peer discovery and network config notes.


## mDNS

Local discovery adds the ability to scan local networks for other iroh
endpoints, using Local Swarm Discovery. This is useful for local networks, or
for bootstrapping a network before a relay is available.

Local Discovery is _not_ enabled by default, and must be enabled by the user.
You'll need to add the `discovery-local-network` feature flag to your
`Cargo.toml` to use it.

```toml
[dependencies]
# Make sure to use the most recent version here instead of nn. (at the time of writing: 0.32)
iroh = { version = "0.nn", features = ["discovery-local-network"] }
```

Then configure your endpoint to use local discovery concurrently with the default DNS discovery:

```rust
use iroh::Endpoint;

let mdns = iroh::discovery::mdns::MdnsDiscovery::builder();
let ep = Endpoint::builder()
    .discovery(mdns)
    .bind()
    .await?;
```
