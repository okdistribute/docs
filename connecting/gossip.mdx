title: "Broadcast via gossip topics"
---

Gossip protocols let peers broadcast messages to subscribers of a topic
without relying on a central broker. Each node tracks a small set of
neighbors and forwards messages redundantly so they reach interested peers
even when nodes join, leave, or fail.


In P2P networks each node typically only knows a handful of neighbors. Gossip
protocols accept that partial view and use probabilistic forwarding so messages
eventually reach most or all subscribers.

Characteristics
- Peers may join, leave, change addresses, or drop messages at any time.
- Gossip spreads information redundantly across overlapping paths, which
	improves resilience but increases traffic.

What gossip must handle
- Subscription propagation: efficiently informing the network who is
	interested in which topics.
- Message dissemination: delivering published messages to subscribers with
	acceptable latency and a reasonable bandwidth cost.

How gossip compares to centralized systems
- Central brokers (Kafka, MQTT, Pulsar) keep authoritative topic membership
	and provide stronger delivery guarantees, but introduce a single point of
	failure and operational overhead.
- Gossip trades strict guarantees for decentralization, simplicity, and
	resilience in highly dynamic environments.

When to use gossip
- Lightweight broadcast where eventual delivery is acceptable.
- Dynamic membership (peers frequently join/leave or change addresses).
- No single point of failure is desired.

When not to use gossip
- Strong delivery guarantees (exactly-once) or strict global ordering are
	required.

## iroh-gossip

The `iroh-gossip` protocol is based on *epidemic broadcast trees* to disseminate
messages among a swarm of peers interested in a *topic*.  The implementation is
based on the papers
[HyParView](https://asc.di.fct.unl.pt/~jleitao/pdf/dsn07-leitao.pdf) and
[PlumTree](https://asc.di.fct.unl.pt/~jleitao/pdf/srds07-leitao.pdf).
