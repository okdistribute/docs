title: "Custom Relays"

By default, iroh will use public shared relays to facilitate connections over
DNS. These relays handle both forwarding traffic when direct peer-to-peer
connections are not possible as well as facilitate holepunching for direct
connections. These relays are managed and maintained by the n0des team, and are
shared by a global public network of developers.

By default, all iroh endpoints will use the public cloud relays unless you
purchase a managed relay or deploy your own self-hosted relay.

## Self-Hosted and Managed Relays

If you require more control over your relay infrastructure, you can choose to
[self-host your own relay](https://github.com/n0-computer/iroh/tree/main/iroh-relay) or [upgrade to a managed relay service](https://n0des.iroh.computer). This allows you
to have full control over the relay servers, including their configuration,
security settings, and access controls.
