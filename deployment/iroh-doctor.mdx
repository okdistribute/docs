## Home Relay

All iroh endpoints will maintain a single home relay server that they're reachable at. On startup iroh will probe its configured relays & choose the one with the lowest latency.

You can see this in action with [iroh doctor](https://github.com/n0-computer/iroh-doctor):

```shell
$ iroh-doctor report
getting report using relay map RelayMap {
    nodes: {
        RelayUrl(
            "https://aps1-1.relay.iroh.network./",
        ): RelayNode {
            url: RelayUrl(
                "https://aps1-1.relay.iroh.network./",
            ),
            stun_only: false,
            stun_port: 3478,
        },
        ...
    },
}

            RelayUrl(

            ): 229.446041ms,
            RelayUrl(
                "https://euw1-1.relay.iroh.network./",
            ): 98.979167ms,
            RelayUrl(
                "https://use1-1.relay.iroh.network./",
            ): 10.133208ms,
        },
    ),
    relay_v4_latency: RelayLatencies(
        {
            RelayUrl(
                "https://aps1-1.relay.iroh.network./",
            ): 229.446041ms,
            ...
        },
    ),
    relay_v6_latency: RelayLatencies(
        {
            RelayUrl(
                "https://aps1-1.relay.iroh.network./",
            ): 238.579417ms,
            ...

    ),

    global_v6: Some([2600:**:**:***::100b]:53549),
    captive_portal: None,
}
```

The above output shows that the endpoint is using the `use1-1.relay.iroh.network` relay, and that it has a latency of 10ms. This is the relay that the endpoint will use to establish connections with other endpoints.
