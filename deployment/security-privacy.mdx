iroh is designed with security and privacy as core principles. This document
outlines the key security and privacy features of iroh, as well as best
practices for deploying and using iroh in a secure manner.

## End-to-End Encryption

All data transmitted between iroh endpoints is protected with end-to-end
encryption. This means that data is encrypted on the sender's device and can only
be decrypted by the intended recipient. Even relay servers that facilitate
connections between endpoints cannot read the data being transmitted.

End-to-end encryption is achieved using modern cryptographic algorithms and protocols,
ensuring that data remains confidential and secure during transit. By defaul;t,
iroh uses Ed25519 keys for endpoint identities and encryption. If you require
different cryptographic algorithms, you can configure iroh to use them during
endpoint creation.

## Public Relays

All traffic sent through the public relays is end-to-end encrypted. The relays
are not able to read any of the traffic that they forward or help connect.
However, the relays are able to see metadata about connections, such as source
and destination IP addresses, connection times, and the amount of data
transferred.

We recommend that you do not use the public relays for sensitive or confidential
data. If you need more control over your relay infrastructure, we recommend that
you upgrade to a managed relay or self-host your own relay.

We monitor the public relays for abuse and malicious activity. If we detect
abuse, we reserve the right to block offending IP addresses or users from
accessing the public relays.

To learn more about deploying and managing your own relays, see the
[n0des](//managing-relays) documentation.
